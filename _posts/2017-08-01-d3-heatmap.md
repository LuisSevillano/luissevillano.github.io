      I wrote this small piece of code to create a kind of <i>heatmap/calendar</i> with d3. One day a coworker asked me to create a interactive graph that could show a calendar of fruits and vegetables.

      It had to be responsive and able to read the data from a json. So I wrote it following Mike Bostock's <a href="https://bost.ocks.org/mike/nest/">Nested selections</a>.

      It's not a plugin to the way you instantiate an object and you access a number of methods. I just decided to keep the basics in a repository so I could access it in the future if I need it or someone else.

      It uses rollup.js and sass. You just need to execute <b>npm install</b> and <b>npm start</b>.
