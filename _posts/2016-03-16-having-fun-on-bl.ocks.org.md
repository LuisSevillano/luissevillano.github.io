<p>I wrote <a target="_blank" href="http://bl.ocks.org/LuisSevillano/7646cfbf60cb32b864c9">this</a> example of step linear chart using d3.js, a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data created by <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/mbostock">Mike Bostock</a> and the main tool I use each day. Bl.ocks is a simple viewer for sharing code examples hosted on GitHub Gist and a good way to save and keep it to access faster. <a href="http://bl.ocks.org/LuisSevillano">Here's mine</a>.
