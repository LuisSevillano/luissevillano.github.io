    <p>This month I had the opportunity of collaborate in a wonderful project, a custom Dixit game as a wedding gift for one of my best friends.</p>
    <p>Each of the people who participated in it would make as many <i>cards</i> as he wanted. Some of them handmade that would then be scanned and others digital.</p> 
    <p>As the wedding will be in <i>A Illa de Arousa</i>, a really nice site in the estuary of Villa Garc√≠a de Aousa (Pontevedra, Galicia), I decided to create a fictional map of the island as if it were an old ancient map that marked the place where a treasure is hidden, in this case the place where the wedding would be. I am not a professional cartographer, much less but I really enjoyed doing this project.</p>
    <p class="p-break">I use GDAL to create the shaded relief. QGIS to create the base map with OSM data (buildings, roads) and the composition. Then I use Photoshop for the effects and Illustrator to create some paths.</p>

            <p class="p-break">A few weeks ago I was on the island and was surprised by its orography. This has a huge bridge that was built in the eighties. When I returned I was looking at old aerial images to see how the evolution of the place had been. I make this gif:</p>
