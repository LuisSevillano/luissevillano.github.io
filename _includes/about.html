    <p>I’m a Graphics Reporter at EL PAÍS, where I bridge the gap between complex data and visual storytelling. I design and develop both static and interactive experiences that bring clarity and context to the most pressing stories of our time.</p>
    <p>My work is driven by a fascination for maps and remote sensing. I leverage a bird's-eye view to uncover hidden narratives within the territory, ranging from election results to the frontlines of environmental crises.</p>
